Boards and modules for nmea wifi router. 

The files in this repository contain the schematics and boards of the 
vYacht Wifi Router. This router allows to connect directly to the NMEA 
network and distribute navigational information via Wifi or ethernet.

This router is certainly the easiest and most cost effective gateway between 
the NMEA boat on-board network and instruments and your PC or iPad/Android. All 
connections are fully isolated to avoid ground loops.

The router operates with the typical on-board 12V power supply. It has 
an efficient 12V to 3.3V step down buck converter. 

Software
====

The router runs a modified openwrt as operating system.

The NMEA Wifi Router uses a RT3050 based Carambola as CPU and Wifi module. The Carambola 
board is unfortuntely based on a proprietary design and Ralink releases even data sheets 
only under NDA. But the Carambola board is currently the most cost effective and powerful 
Wifi and CPU solution known to me.


Version
====

Current version of this board is v8.
